# Remix + Deno

Welcome to the Deno template for Remix! ü¶ï

For more, check out the [Remix docs](https://remix.run/docs).

## Install

```sh
npx create-remix@latest --template deno
```

## Managing dependencies

Read about [how we recommend to manage dependencies for Remix projects using Deno](https://github.com/remix-run/remix/blob/main/decisions/0001-use-npm-to-manage-npm-dependencies-for-deno-projects.md).

- ‚úÖ You should use `npm` to install NPM packages
  ```sh
  npm install react
  ```
  ```ts
  import { useState } from "react";
  ```
- ‚úÖ You may use inlined URL imports or [deps.ts](https://deno.land/manual/examples/manage_dependencies#managing-dependencies) for Deno modules.
  ```ts
  import { copy } from "https://deno.land/std@0.138.0/streams/conversion.ts";
  ```
- ‚ùå Do not use [import maps](https://deno.land/manual/linking_to_external_code/import_maps).

## Development

From your terminal:

```sh
npm run dev
```

This starts your app in development mode, rebuilding assets on file changes.

## Production

First, build your app for production:

```sh
npm run build
```

Then run the app in production mode:

```sh
npm start
```

## Deployment

Building the Deno app (`npm run build`) results in two outputs:

- `build/` (server bundle)
- `public/build/` (browser bundle)

You can deploy these bundles to a host of your choice, just make sure it runs Deno!
